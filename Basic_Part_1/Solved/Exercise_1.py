# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).

# Sample String: "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, 
# Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are!"

print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are! \n\t\tUp above the world so high, \n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are!")


# In Python strings, the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. 
# It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return.

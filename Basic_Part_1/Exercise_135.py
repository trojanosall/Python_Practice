# Write a Python program to print a variable without spaces between values. Go to the editor
# Sample value : x =30
# Expected output : Value of x is "30"

x = 30
print('Value of x is "{}"'.format(x))

# The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.

# The placeholder is defined using curly brackets: {}.

# The placeholders can be identified using named indexes {price}, numbered indexes {0}, or even empty placeholders {}.

# The format() method returns the formatted string.
